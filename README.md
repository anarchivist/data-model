**NOTE: Until this notice is removed, these rights statements are understood
be a pre-release and thus not suitable for production use.**

This repository contains the proposed implementation of interoperable rights
statements developed by the International Rights Statement Working Group. 
More information about the motivation and implementation of these statements
can be found in the following draft white papers:

* [Recommendations for Standardized International Rights Statements](http://bit.ly/1F9Zw1M)
* [Recommendations for the Technical Infrastructure for Standardized International Rights Statements](http://bit.ly/1QtmmmT)

The rights statements are currently implemented as a [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/)
vocabulary serialized in [Turtle](http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).
